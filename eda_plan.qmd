## Glimpse of the data

* First few 
* Last few 
* Random selection

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("data/original/finalmerged_data.csv")
head(df)
tail(df)
df %>% slice_sample(n=6)
```


The idea is to quickly see if there are any immediate obvious errors

## A more detailed look

* Structure of the data - variables coded correctly? 
* Summary statistics 
* How many missing values?
```{r}
glimpse(df)
str(df)
summary(df)
```


## Visualizations

* Response vs. explanatory variables 
* With and without oddly behaving points

## Basic models
